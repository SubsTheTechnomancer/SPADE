Introduction to keyword typing.
Typing keywords is not very hard in Streampunk, All you need to do is to put a \ in front of it.
This is true \for all keywords except the p-rint keyword and the hyphen, which is required to be typed with a hyphen in front of it (as per the Streampunk Effective Coding Standard [SECS]).
printl "Full stop\.".
printl "\"Quotes\"".
printl "\for, \if, \endif, \endfor".
printl "Slash\\ ".
printl "Hyphen -- and p-rint and p-rintl".
